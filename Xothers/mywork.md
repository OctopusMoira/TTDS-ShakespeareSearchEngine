# This is to record my work, which is to be put inside the report.

I identified project targets and jobs for team members and started off the project. I created a fully-connected skeleton project on Docker (docker-compose), which consists of the front-end (React) and back-end (Flask, mongoDB) and is easily reproducible. I found collections of Shakespeare's (in xml). I extracted lines/information (mainly use beautifulsoup). I preprocessed raw data (concatenating complete lines that are seperated etc.) in preparation for further processing. I made BM25 query search and used LSTM to train a naive prediction model for query suggestion. After receiving teammate's work on regular expression and phonetics search, I further processed all data and transformed them into resonable structures. I managed mongodb and used pymongo to save all data. I managed the back-end using Flask, transferring all query logic, connecting with mongo, front-end and prediction model. I cooperated with my teammates on front-end designing and coding. Lastly, I deployed the whole project onto the server.
